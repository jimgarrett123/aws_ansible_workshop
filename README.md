<h1>Ansible on Clouds - AWS - RHPDS Guide</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


Thank you for using the **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform on AWS** lab environment.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>Red Hat Account</h3>

You will need a valid Red Hat account in order to retrieve an Ansible entitlement.  In order to avoid possible corporate permissions issues, it's recommended that you create a personal account and use this when performing this lab.  Please create a personal account and ensure that you are able to login to **[Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console](https://console.redhat.com/)** successfully.

<h3>Obtain AWS Credentials/Keys</h3>

You will get these **from your instructor**.  You will need the console link, and the credentials to proceed.  For example, a console link would look like https://970712874119.signin.aws.amazon.com/console and when used would take you to a login screen.  Obtain your console link, username and password from your instructor and login to the AWS Console.
